# Bluppy OS

An experimental OS that gets developed as I learn new things.
All the development happens in the `devl` branch, a clone of this branch may or may not work
working snapshots merged to the master. So cloning the master will give you a stable(kind of) version.

## what is the whole thing about..

as mentioned above it's just an OS for me have fun with. adding new features as I learn how to implement them.
